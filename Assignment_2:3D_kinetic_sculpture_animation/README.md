## Model Usage and Integration

### Parametric Pattern Implementation
The parametric pattern model from STEELWORX is integrated as a key decorative element in the kinetic sculpture:

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Source Format**: Original DXF file converted to GLTF format
- **Rendering Method**: Line-based rendering using GL_LINES primitive
- **Animation**: Three instances with independent orbital motion
- **Color Scheme**: Cyan (0.0, 1.0, 1.0) for high visibility against dark background

#### **Animation Features:**
- **Orbital Motion**: Patterns orbit around the main sculpture at radius 4.0 units
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Size varies sinusoidally (0.8 - 1.0 scale factor)
- **Multi-axis Rotation**: Y-axis rotation + X-axis oscillation
- **Wind Response**: Z-axis rotation affected by wind strength
- **Phase Offset**: Each pattern has different animation phase for variety

#### **Performance Considerations:**
- **Vertex Count**: 2,500 vertices per pattern (7,500 total)
- **Index Count**: 4,802 indices per pattern (14,406 total)
- **Rendering**: Efficient line rendering with proper depth testing
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized buffer management with VAO/VBO/EBO

### Creative Adaptation
While the original model is a static 2D parametric pattern, it has been creatively adapted for kinetic sculpture:
- **3D Positioning**: Elevated and positioned in 3D space
- **Dynamic Movement**: Transformed from static to animated element
- **Environmental Integration**: Responds to wind and user interaction
- **Visual Enhancement**: Enhanced with lighting and color effects
