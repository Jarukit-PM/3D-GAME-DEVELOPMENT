# Resources Folder

This folder contains assets and resources for the 3D Kinetic Sculpture Animation project.

## Usage

Place your project assets here, such as:
- Texture files (.png, .jpg, .bmp)
- 3D model files (.obj, .fbx, .gltf)
- Audio files (.wav, .mp3, .ogg)
- Configuration files (.json, .xml)
- Any other resources needed by the application

## File Organization

Consider organizing files into subdirectories:
- `textures/` - for image files
- `models/` - for 3D model files
- `audio/` - for sound files
- `config/` - for configuration files

## Loading Resources

Resources are automatically copied to the build directory during compilation, so you can reference them using relative paths from the executable location.
